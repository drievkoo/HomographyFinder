# HomographyFinder
Interactive application for finding homography between image plane and custom 3D plane in image.

Finding the homography is based on virtual grid that is shown to the user. The user has to manually
place the grid so that it lays on a plane in image, thus specifying two planes: custom 3D plane like wall, 
floor, ... and image plane itself. Homography gives relationship between these two planes.
